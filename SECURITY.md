## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Nuggets projects, we'd love to hear from you.

We take all security bugs extremely seriously. Where confirmed upon investigation; we will create a patch for the issue
(timescales depending upon severity). A public security bulletin discussing the impact will then be released (crediting
the discoverer).

The best way to report a security bug is to email a description of the flaw and any related information to
[support@nuggets.life](mailto:support@nuggets.life). Please include as much information as possible, including steps to
reproduce.
